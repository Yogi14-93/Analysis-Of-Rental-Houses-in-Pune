# 🏠 Analysis of Rental Houses in Pune (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of rental houses in Pune city.
The main aim is to understand how rent prices vary across different locations and identify the key factors that affect rental prices, such as area, number of rooms, and amenities.

This project is part of my learning journey in Data Analytics, where I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world data.
