# 🏠 Analysis of Rental Houses in Pune (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of rental house listings in Pune city.
The aim is to understand how rent prices vary across locations and what factors influence rental rates, such as property size, number of rooms, and amenities.

This project helped me apply data analysis concepts on real-world housing data and extract meaningful insights.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

Understand rental price patterns across different areas of Pune

Identify factors affecting rent (location, area, BHK, amenities)

Compare rental prices for different property types

Identify premium and high-demand rental locations

Practice end-to-end EDA on real data


## 📊 Dataset & Data Collection

Data was collected using web scraping from real estate listings

Tools used for scraping: Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas

The raw data was messy and unstructured, similar to real industry data


## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Cleaned rent, area, BHK, bathrooms, and location columns

Converted columns into correct data types

Created new columns to support analysis


## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Rent distribution and area distribution

Rent comparison across top locations

Relationship between rent and area

Impact of BHK, bathrooms, and amenities on rent

Identification of premium rental areas


## 💡 Key Insights

Most rental houses fall in the ₹50k–₹80k range

Majority of properties are between 1000–2000 sq ft

Rent increases as area increases

Location has a strong impact on rent

Verde Kalyani Nagar has the highest average rent

Amenities like garden and gym are common in most properties

⚠️ Note:
All insights are based on my observations from the available data.
Additional insights may also be derived with deeper or different analysis.
